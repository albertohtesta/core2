# Norden Core Services - Backend

## System dependencies
* Docker (If you are on macOS use the desktop version üòÅ)
* Ruby 3.1.1
* Rails 7.0.2

## Configuration
Please follow the steps below in the order they are presented.

### Clone the project
This project is composed of other projects as submodules. To add them from the start, please run
```console
git clone --recurse-submodules git@git.michelada.io:norden/core-backend.git
```
If you already had this project, you can add the submodules with
```console
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Update the submodules
In order to update the submodules of this project, please run
```console
git submodule update --recursive
```

### Create the env file
Copy the contents of `.env.dev` and paste them into a new file called `.env.dev.local`. Or you can create a new file with `touch .env.dev.local`.

### Load the containers
Since Docker loads all the dependencies as containers, all you have to do is clone the repo and run 
```console
docker-compose run core-backend sh -c "./bin/setup"
```
and then:
```console
docker-compose up core-backend
```
That will fetch you rails, redis, postgres, rabbitMQ, sidekiq, download and install the needed gems, setup the DB and prepare the ground for the backend and frontend projects.

### Set the data up
**_This step is only necessary if you could not create the DB with the first command from the section above._**

**While the container is running**, in another console prompt, run 
```console
docker-compose exec core-backend sh
```
to bring up the **core-backend** container shell. Inside the shell, create the development and testing databases with 
```console
bin/rails db:create
```
and then run the migrations with 
```console
bin/rails db:migrate
```
Leave the shell with `exit`.

### Finishing steps
You should be ready to go! Below you can find some [docker commands](https://git.michelada.io/norden/core-backend/-/wikis/Docker) that might prove useful in your development process.
If you need the **master.key** or need help with anything else please reach out to the team.

### Best practices

## Testing

### Run test 
to bring up the **core-backend** container shell. Inside the shell run test
```console
bin/rails t
```
